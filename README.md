# Reproducibility Study: DP-LORA

This repository contains the code and documentation for the reproducibility study of [Differentially Private Fine-Tuning of
Diffusion
Models](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2025/papers/Tsai_Differentially_Private_Fine-Tuning_of_Diffusion_Models_ICCV_2025_paper.pdf).

## Installation

The directory `dp_lora` contains the code required to pretrain and finetune the models. To set up the Python environment using Anaconda, run the script: 
```
dp_lora/setup_env.sh
```

## Usage

The `jobs` directory contains SLURM job scripts for the different experiments.

*TO DO:* add a list of job scripts and explain which results they produce.
